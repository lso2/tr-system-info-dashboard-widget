## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### Installation & Setup

**Q: Does this plugin slow down my website?**
A: No! The plugin has zero impact on frontend performance. It only loads in the WordPress admin area and uses efficient caching mechanisms. All monitoring happens in the background with minimal resource usage.

**Q: Will this work with my hosting provider?**
A: Yes! The plugin works on all hosting types: shared hosting, VPS, dedicated servers, managed WordPress hosting, and cloud platforms. It automatically adapts to different server configurations and detects various server software (Apache, NGINX, etc.).

**Q: Can I use this on multisite installations?**
A: Absolutely! The plugin is fully compatible with WordPress multisite networks and will display network-specific information when applicable.

### Settings & Configuration

**Q: How do I customize which sections appear in the dashboard?**
A: Go to **System Info** in your admin menu. The settings page displays live previews of all 8 dashboard sections. Click any section card to enable/disable it instantly. Use the "Toggle Dashboard Widget" master control to enable/disable the entire widget.

**Q: Can I disable the entire dashboard widget?**
A: Yes! Use the "Toggle Dashboard Widget" master control in the settings page. When disabled, the widget won't appear on the dashboard at all.

**Q: Do my settings save automatically?**
A: Yes! All settings use AJAX and save instantly when you click section cards. You'll see visual confirmation with status tags updating from "DISABLED" to "ENABLED" and vice versa.

### Memory Testing & Analysis

**Q: How do I interpret the memory usage data?**
A: Memory usage is displayed in MB. The plugin shows current usage, limits, and percentages. Values over 50MB per plugin may indicate optimization opportunities. The color-coded progress bars help identify concerning levels: green (good), orange (warning), red (critical).

**Q: How does the Memory Measurement Tool work?**
A: The tool automatically reloads the page multiple times (1-100 configurable) at set intervals (500ms-10s) to measure memory usage accurately. It calculates average, minimum, maximum, and range values. The tool also tracks which plugins were active during testing for impact analysis.

**Q: What should I do if I find a plugin using too much memory?**
A: First, use the Memory Measurement Tool to establish a baseline. Then deactivate the suspect plugin and run another test. Compare results to see the actual impact. Consider if the plugin is essential, look for alternatives, or contact the plugin developer about optimization.

### Data & Privacy

**Q: Does this plugin collect any personal data?**
A: No! The plugin only monitors your server's system information locally. No data is transmitted externally. All information stays within your WordPress installation.

**Q: Where is the data stored?**
A: All data is stored in your WordPress database using the WordPress options API. Test history, plugin memory data, and settings are stored locally and can be cleared at any time.

### Compatibility & Integration

**Q: Is this plugin compatible with caching plugins?**
A: Yes! The plugin works alongside all caching solutions and can actually help you monitor their effectiveness by tracking memory usage patterns.

**Q: Does it work with page builders and complex themes?**
A: Absolutely! The plugin monitors system-level information and works with any theme or plugin combination. It's particularly useful for identifying which page builders or themes consume the most memory.

**Q: Can I use this with development tools and staging sites?**
A: Perfect for development! The plugin is ideal for comparing memory usage across development, staging, and production environments. Use it to test plugin combinations and optimizations before deploying to live sites.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: The live memory monitor isn't updating. What should I do?**
A: Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser. The live monitor uses AJAX to update every 3 seconds. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors and ensure the plugin is properly activated.

**Q: Memory test gets stuck or doesn't complete. How to fix?**
A: Use the "Cancel Test" button to stop the current test. Check if any plugins are causing JavaScript conflicts. You can also try reducing the number of measurements or increasing the interval between measurements.

**Q: I don't see all sections in my dashboard widget. Why?**
A: Check the **System Info** settings page. Some sections may be disabled. Click section cards to enable them, or use the master "Toggle Dashboard Widget" control to enable the entire widget.

### Advanced Usage

**Q: How can I use this for client site audits?**
A: The plugin provides comprehensive system information perfect for client reports. Export the system overview, database analysis, and memory usage data. Use the memory testing tool to identify optimization opportunities and provide concrete recommendations.

**Q: Can I monitor multiple sites?**
A: Install the plugin on each site you want to monitor. Each installation tracks its own data independently. The consistent interface makes it easy to compare system information across multiple WordPress installations.
